=========================

Use your NES controller for different applications with a Arduino Micro

Using a Arduino Micro (or a Leonardo) you can use a NES controller as a keyboard for different games that doesn't support a controller driver.  The NES controller is a shift register that will shift a high/low states of the buttons in the following order: B, A, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right.  Using array's called through a switch it's able to be expanded upon and using a button you could cycle through different profiles.
